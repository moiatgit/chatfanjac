This project is an attempt to prepare an activity for Fanjac

It is all about a chat

The full code can be found at:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-chat-room-using-python/

The steps are:

- make original code work

- check dependencies and decide if you need to warn students

- prepare a path to build the whole thing with easy but engaging steps

Enhancements

- convert to python3

- add clients the hability to set a name (currently there's just the ip and is not a proper identifier when testing from the same machine)

- add clients a command to end the connection gratefully

- add server a summary of the number of current clients and, maybe, the names
  Some kind of log
