- NOW: reimplement server

    main thread reads from console commands: at least quit

    listener thread accepts new connections and ends when:
    - event is set

    participant thread manages a client connection and ends when:
    - event is set
    - participant connection is broken
    - participant sent {quit}

- client should finish with ctrl-c instead of {quit}
    - not sure of this now!

- server should notify new enterings and leavings with a unnamed message

- clients should launch with the name specified in the command line

- server side
    - more modularity
    - consider what happens when the connexion is lost before receiving client name
    - consider broadcasting close connection when server is down
    - check how to discover server ip or ask for it when launching
    - when closing connection (ctr-c) it keeps running.


Further exercises ideas:

- yes wanna

- server accepts commands to send a message to a concrete participant or even
  finishing they (e.g. because of missbehavior)
